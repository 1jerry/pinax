Pinax: a platform for rapidly developing websites
http://pinaxproject.com/

Pinax is an MIT-licensed, open-source platform built on the Django Web
Framework.

By integrating numerous reusable Django apps to take care of the things
that many sites have in common, it lets you focus on what makes your
site different.

While our initial development was focused around a demo social
networking site, Pinax is suitable for a wide variety of websites. We
are working on number of editions tailored to intranets, event
management, learning management, software project management and more.

Task tracking and Wiki are at http://code.pinaxproject.com/

Most discussion about Pinax takes place on the IRC channel #pinax on
Freenode or the pinax-users mailing list on Google Groups.
