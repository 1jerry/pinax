Pinax should be run in a virtual environment containing pip, Django and Pinax
itself. We have provided a script that will create this virtual environment
for you. Once you have downloaded the release tarball, cd into the extracted
directory. Let's create a virtual environment that you will install everything
into::

    python scripts/pinax-boot.py --release 0.7beta1 ../pinax-env
    cd ../
    source ./pinax-env/bin/activate

Note that we have told you to create the new environment in the directory
above the tarball directory. We encourage you create the environment anywhere
you like.

If you use virtualenvwrapper (we highly encourage you do), you can easily
replace ../ with your WORKON_HOME. This gives you regular access to workon
to activate your environment.

Your next step is to create a Pinax project. Let's first check what is
available::

    pinax-admin clone_project -l

This will show you a list of project that you can base your new project off
of. For the purpose of testing Pinax, lets start with the social_project::

    pinax-admin clone_project social_project mysite

This will create a new Pinax project called 'mysite' in your current working
directory. Lastly, let's get it running::

    cd mysite/
    python manage.py syncdb
    python manage.py runserver

Point your browser at http://localhost:8000/ and you should see the Pinax
default homepage!
