Pinax should be run in a virtualenv containing pip, Django and Pinax
itself.

To install all required external apps and libraries, activate the
virtualenv and run

    pip install --requirement requirements/external_apps.txt

You should then be able to cd into a sample project under projects and
run ./manage.py syncdb and ./manage.py runserver to get running
immediately.
