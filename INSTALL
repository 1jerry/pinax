Pinax should be run in a virtualenv containing pip, Django and Pinax
itself. We have done all this work for you. Once you have downloaded the
release tarball, cd yourself into the extracted directory. Lets create a
virtual environment that you will install everything into::

    python scripts/pinax-boot.py --release 0.7beta1 ../pinax-env
    cd ../
    source ./pinax-env/bin/activate

Note that we have told you to create the new environment in the directory
above the tarball directory. We encourage you create the environment where
you like.

If you use virtualenvwrapper (we highly encourage you do), you can easily
replace ../ with your WORKON_HOME.

Your next step is to create a Pinax project. Lets first check what is
available::

    pinax-admin clone_project -l

This will show you a list of project that you can base your new project off
of. For the purpose of testing Pinax, lets start with the social_project::

    pinax-admin clone_project social_project mysite

This will create a new Pinax project called 'mysite' in your current working
directory. Lastly, lets get it running::

    cd mysite/
    python manage.py syncdb
    python manage.py runserver

Point your browswer at http://localhost:8000/ and you should see the Pinax
homepage!
