Frequently asked questions
==========================

Does Pinax work on Django 1.1?
------------------------------

Yes. Pinax 0.7 ships with Django 1.0.4 by default. Django 1.1 came too late in
our 0.7 release cycle. However, we tested it on Django 1.1 to ensure it works
and it works well. To use Django 1.1 in your Pinax project simply follow our
:ref:`installation <ref-install>` documentation and once you are in the
virtual environment run::

    pip install -U Django==1.1.1

This will install Django 1.1.1 over 1.0.4.

How do I change the references to example.com
---------------------------------------------

``example.com`` is the default value for
``Site.objects.get(pk=settings.SITE_ID).domain``. This comes from the Django
contrib app named ``sites``. It is enabled in Pinax by default. Pinax uses
this value to construct URLs back to your site in e-mails, for example. There
are two ways to change this value. First, you can modify it in the shell
(using ``python manage.py shell``)::

    >>> from django.conf import settings
    >>> from django.contrib.sites.models import Site
    >>> site = Site.objects.get(pk=settings.SITE_ID)
    >>> site.domain = "localhost:8000"
    >>> site.name = "Development site"
    >>> site.save()

Alternatively, you can perform the same action through the admin interface.
