====================================
 Developer Code Repository Workflow
====================================

There is a different "workflow" for developers with Commit privilege
and those without.  


Developers with Commit Privileges
=================================

[TBD]


Developers without Commit Privileges
====================================

Login to http://github.com and search for Pinax or go directly here::

  http://github.com/pinax/pinax/tree/master

Use the 'fork' button to fork the Pinax tree to your area. This
invokes a "Hardcore Forking Action".

Grab the "Your Clone" URL from the page, using the Flash button if you
have Flash. It gives you something like this::

  git@github.com:yourusername/pinax.git

Clone this to your computer: in the current pinax-boot installation,
cd to src/ and then::

  git clone git@github.com:yourusername/pinax.git

Do your development in src/pinax, test, later, rinse, repeat. When
you're satisfied with your changes, ``git commit`` them to your local
repository copy and send it back up to your fork on Github::

  git push

When you're ready for the committers to review your changes for
acceptance, go to your fork on Github (e.g.,
``http://github.com/yourusername/pinax/tree/master``) then hit the "pull
request" button to notify the committers.
